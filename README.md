# CommRaspArd

Problem Statement:

System1 has a microcontroller (Arduino) which actuates a stepper motor for 30 degrees 'n' number of times. 
The variable 'n' is stored in the memory of the controller.
System 2 has a raspberry pi which communicates with the arduino board.
Write a program in python to establish the communication between system 1 and 2, 
and change the value of 'n' in the microcontroller whenever needed.
